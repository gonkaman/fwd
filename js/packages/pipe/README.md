# pipe

*Description: Todo*

In functional programming, a pipe is a function that allows you to chain a sequence of functions together from left-to-right. The output of one function becomes the input of the next function in the sequence. This is useful for composing complex operations from simpler ones.

For example, let’s say you have three functions f1, f2, and f3. You can use a pipe to apply these functions to an input value x in the following way: f3(f2(f1(x))). This can be cumbersome to read and write, especially when you have many functions in the sequence. Instead, you can use a pipe to write this as: x |> f1 |> f2 |> f3.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, pipes are not supported natively as an operator. However, you can implement pipes using a custom function. Here’s an example implementation of a pipe function in TypeScript:

*TypeScript*
```typescript
const pipe = <T>(...fns: Array<(arg: T) => T>) => (value: T) =>
  fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), value);
  ```

This implementation takes any number of functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies them in sequence from left-to-right.


- you need all the functions to chain to build the pipe
- All functions need to have the same input and output type T
